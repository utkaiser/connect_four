# Connect Four

This repository contains a simple implementation of the tic-tac-toe two-play connection board game 
["connect four"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) in Java. The players choose 
a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid; the
object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
Since the board is vertical, pieces drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column.
The numbers of possible positions after n = 0, 1, 2, ... have been played is 
1, 7, 56, 252, 1260, 4620, 18480,...<br><br>
You can play the game by running the `main-function` in [Game.java](src/de/uniwue/jpp/connect_four/Game.java).
Below you can see a gameplay video.
